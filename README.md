# Android App Making Process
***

### 1. Plan your app
In order to make the app making part a bit easier, 
plan out your app _before_ you start coding/designing.
Planning will make things flow easier and faster, as well as eliminate 
future headaches.

### 2. Get your tools
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html?gclid=Cj0KEQiA2uDEBRDxurOO77Cp-7kBEiQAOUgKV04Cp7VZzXEpj0LuC62iQ3dySuBOrDt2VJg0K7bKHd4aAoNP8P8HAQ) is the main tool for creating Android apps.
It is based off of the IntelliJ Java IDE. It also comes with a preinstalled Android Emulator;
therefore, you do _not_ need a physical Android phone to run your apps

### 3. Learn the language
Android apps are made in Java (and sometimes C++ and C#).
