# Android App Making Process
***

### 1. Plan your app
In order to make the app making part a bit easier, 
plan out your app _before_ you start coding/designing.
Planning will make things flow easier and faster, as well as eliminate 
future headaches.

### 2. Get your tools
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html?gclid=Cj0KEQiA2uDEBRDxurOO77Cp-7kBEiQAOUgKV04Cp7VZzXEpj0LuC62iQ3dySuBOrDt2VJg0K7bKHd4aAoNP8P8HAQ) is the main tool for creating Android apps.
It is based off of the IntelliJ Java IDE. It also comes with a preinstalled Android Emulator;
therefore, you do _not_ need a physical Android phone to run your apps.

### 3. Learn the language
Android apps are made in Java (and sometimes C++ and C#). Java is a _compiled_ language
(Python was an _interpreted_ language). Java is also more verbose, or "Strongly typed"
language than Java. For example, a "Hello world" program in python would be like this:
```Python
  print("Hello world")
```

Where as a "Hello world" program in Java would be like so:

```java
public class HelloWorldExample{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello world");
  }
}
```

As you can see, Java has more words and lines to do the same thing, but this
brings a certain amount of customizability to Java that Python doesn't have. 

### 4. Learn the software

Android Studio comes with a build in designer for designing the UI (User interface)
of your app.
