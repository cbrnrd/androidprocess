# Android App Making Process
***

### 1. Plan your app
In order to make the app making part a bit easier, 
plan out your app _before_ you start coding/designing.
Planning will make things flow easier and faster, as well as eliminate 
future headaches.

### 2. Get your tools
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html?gclid=Cj0KEQiA2uDEBRDxurOO77Cp-7kBEiQAOUgKV04Cp7VZzXEpj0LuC62iQ3dySuBOrDt2VJg0K7bKHd4aAoNP8P8HAQ) is the main tool for creating Android apps.
It is based off of the IntelliJ Java IDE. It also comes with a preinstalled Android Emulator;
therefore, you do _not_ need a physical Android phone to run your apps. As well as Android Studio, you will need
the Android SDK (Software Development Kit). The SDK usually comes with Android Studio, but there is other SDKs and APIs, 
like the Google Maps API, that you can utilize in your app.

### 3. Learn the language
Android apps are made in Java (and sometimes C++ and C#). Java is a _compiled_ language
(Python was an _interpreted_ language). Java is also more verbose, or "Strongly typed"
language than Java. For example, a "Hello world" program in python would be like this:
```Python
  print("Hello world")
```

Where as a "Hello world" program in Java would be like so:

```java
public class HelloWorldExample{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello world");
  }
}
```

As you can see, Java has more words and lines to do the same thing, but this
brings a certain amount of customizability to Java that Python doesn't have. 
To start jearning Java, go to [codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) 
and go to the 'Java' section. I have also made a bit of a Java cheat sheet you can use for syntax referenct [here](https://github.com/thecarterb/Programming-Cheat-Sheets/tree/master/Java)

### 4. Learn the software

Android Studio comes with a build in designer for designing the UI (User interface)
of your app. If you want your app to look good, practice with the designer and figure out its quirks.
Again, doing this will take out some future headaches in the development process. 

### 5. Read the documentation

This one is apparent with any new language/software. The Java documentation is available [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html), and the Android documentation is available [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html). The [Android Developer site](https://developer.android.com/guide/index.html) has some useful tutorials on how to do certain tasks like animation, data storage, and others.
